# üîç Recurring Payment Investigation Report
**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Investigation**: Production recurring payment analysis

## ‚ùì What We Were Investigating
You mentioned that a recurring payment was just made, and we needed to check:
1. Production logs for WayForPay callback processing
2. Whether recToken/recurringToken was captured and saved
3. Database status of subscription recurring fields
4. Any errors in the payment processing

## üîß Investigation Approach Taken

Since direct access to Render production logs was not available (render-cli had authorization issues), I analyzed the codebase to understand how recurring payments should work and what to look for.

## üìã Key Findings

### ‚úÖ **Code Implementation Status**

1. **WayForPay Callback Handler** (`wayforpay.controller.js`):
   - ‚úÖ Properly extracts `recToken` from callback data (line 298)
   - ‚úÖ Saves recurring fields to subscription:
     - `isRecurring: !!recToken` (line 469)
     - `recurringToken: recToken || null` (line 470) 
     - `recurringMode: 'MONTHLY'` (line 471)
     - `nextPaymentDate: recToken ? nextPaymentDate : null` (line 472)

2. **Database Schema** (`schema.prisma`):
   - ‚úÖ All recurring payment fields are defined:
     - `isRecurring Boolean @default(false)`
     - `recurringToken String?`
     - `recurringMode String?`
     - `nextPaymentDate DateTime?`
     - `lastPaymentDate DateTime?`
     - `failedPaymentAttempts Int @default(0)`

3. **Auto Payment Job** (`autoPaymentJob.js`):
   - ‚úÖ Cron job runs hourly to process recurring payments
   - ‚úÖ Looks for subscriptions with `isRecurring: true` and valid `recurringToken`
   - ‚úÖ Uses WayForPayRecurringService to charge payments
   - ‚úÖ Handles failed payments with retry logic (max 3 attempts)

4. **Recurring Service** (`wayforpayRecurringService.js`):
   - ‚úÖ Implements `chargeRecurringPayment()` method
   - ‚úÖ Proper API signature generation for WayForPay
   - ‚úÖ Error handling and logging

### üîç **What Should Happen During Recurring Payment**

When a recurring payment is made through WayForPay:

1. **Initial Payment Callback**:
   - WayForPay sends callback with `recToken` field
   - Controller logs: `"=== WayForPay Callback Received ==="`
   - Controller extracts and logs field values including `recToken`
   - Subscription record updated with recurring fields

2. **Database Updates**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE colibrrri_subscriptions SET
     isRecurring = true,
     recurringToken = '[TOKEN_VALUE]',
     recurringMode = 'MONTHLY',
     nextPaymentDate = '[DATE_30_DAYS_FROM_NOW]',
     lastPaymentDate = '[CURRENT_DATE]'
   WHERE userId = '[USER_ID]';
   ```

3. **Auto Payment Processing** (hourly cron job):
   - Finds subscriptions where `nextPaymentDate <= now`
   - Charges payment using stored `recurringToken`
   - Updates subscription and adds credits on success
   - Handles failures with retry logic

### üö® **Critical Questions to Check**

To verify if your recurring payment worked, check these in production:

#### **1. Production Logs (Most Important)**
Look for these log patterns around the payment time:

```
=== WayForPay Callback Received ===
Processed callback data: [JSON with recToken field]
üîç Extracted field values: [should show recToken]
‚úÖ Signature verified successfully
‚úÖ Subscription updated
üéâ Successfully added [X] credits to user [email]
```

#### **2. Database Queries to Run**
```sql
-- Check if any subscriptions have recurring tokens
SELECT userId, plan, isRecurring, recurringToken, nextPaymentDate, lastPaymentDate
FROM colibrrri_subscriptions 
WHERE isRecurring = true;

-- Check recent payments with recToken mention
SELECT * FROM colibrrri_payments 
WHERE description LIKE '%AUTO%' OR description LIKE '%recurring%'
ORDER BY createdAt DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check if the recurring fields exist in schema
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'colibrrri_subscriptions' 
AND column_name IN ('isRecurring', 'recurringToken', 'nextPaymentDate');
```

#### **3. WayForPay Configuration Check**
Verify in WayForPay merchant portal:
- Payment buttons have "Regular payments" enabled
- Payment frequency set to "Monthly"  
- Token generation enabled
- Recurring payment mode activated

## üö® **Potential Issues to Investigate**

### Issue 1: Database Migration Not Applied
- **Problem**: The recurring payment fields might not exist in production database
- **Check**: Run `SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'colibrrri_subscriptions';`
- **Fix**: Apply the migration from `add_recurring_fields.sql`

### Issue 2: WayForPay Button Configuration
- **Problem**: Payment buttons not configured for recurring payments
- **Check**: Look for `recToken` in callback logs
- **Fix**: Configure WayForPay buttons to enable recurring payments

### Issue 3: Missing recToken in Callback
- **Problem**: WayForPay not sending `recToken` in callback
- **Check**: Search logs for `"recToken"` or `"Extracted field values"`
- **Fix**: Verify WayForPay button settings and merchant configuration

### Issue 4: Log Parsing Issues
- **Problem**: WayForPay callback might have JSON parsing errors
- **Check**: Look for `"Failed to parse JSON from key"` in logs
- **Fix**: Code already has fallback handling for this

## üìä **Expected vs Actual State**

### If Recurring Payment Worked:
```javascript
// Database should show:
{
  isRecurring: true,
  recurringToken: "some_token_from_wayforpay", 
  recurringMode: "MONTHLY",
  nextPaymentDate: "2025-09-28T[TIME]", // ~30 days from payment
  lastPaymentDate: "2025-08-29T[TIME]"  // payment date
}
```

### If Recurring Payment Failed:
```javascript
// Database would show:
{
  isRecurring: false,        // ‚ùå Should be true
  recurringToken: null,      // ‚ùå Should have token
  recurringMode: null,       // ‚ùå Should be "MONTHLY"
  nextPaymentDate: null,     // ‚ùå Should be future date
  lastPaymentDate: null      // ‚ùå Should be payment date
}
```

## üîß **Next Steps for Debugging**

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Check Production Logs** for WayForPay callback entries
2. **Query Database** to see if recurring fields are populated
3. **Verify WayForPay Button** configuration in merchant portal
4. **Check Cron Job** status (auto payment job running hourly)

### Commands to Run on Production:
```bash
# Check recent logs
render logs --service colibrrri-fullstack --num 100 | grep -i "wayforpay\|callback\|rectoken"

# Connect to database and check subscription
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM colibrrri_subscriptions WHERE isRecurring = true;"
```

## üéØ **Conclusion**

The recurring payment infrastructure is **correctly implemented** in the code. The key question is whether:
1. **Database migration** was applied to add recurring fields
2. **WayForPay button** is configured for recurring payments  
3. **recToken** was actually sent in the callback
4. **Callback processing** succeeded without errors

Without access to production logs, I cannot determine which step failed. The most critical check is to look at the production logs around the payment time for WayForPay callback processing and verify if the recToken was received and saved.
