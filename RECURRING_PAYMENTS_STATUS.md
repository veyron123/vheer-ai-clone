# üìä Recurring Payments Status Report

## Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially Configured**

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### 1. **Code Implementation**
- ‚úÖ WayForPayRecurringService fully implemented
- ‚úÖ Auto payment job scheduler configured (runs hourly)
- ‚úÖ Callback handler processes recToken from WayForPay
- ‚úÖ Retry logic for failed payments (max 3 attempts)
- ‚úÖ Automatic subscription cancellation after max failures

### 2. **Database Schema**
- ‚úÖ Schema updated with recurring payment fields
- ‚úÖ Fields include: isRecurring, recurringToken, recurringMode, nextPaymentDate, etc.

### 3. **Environment Variables**
- ‚úÖ WAYFORPAY_MERCHANT_LOGIN configured
- ‚úÖ WAYFORPAY_MERCHANT_SECRET configured
- ‚úÖ WAYFORPAY_MERCHANT_PASSWORD configured

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

### 1. **Database Migration Not Applied**
- The schema has been updated but migration hasn't been applied to production
- **Action Required**: Run the SQL migration on production database

### 2. **WayForPay Button Configuration**
- Current button URLs don't have recurring payment enabled
- Need to configure WayForPay buttons to support recurring payments

### 3. **No Active Recurring Subscriptions**
- Currently no users have recurring payments enabled
- The recToken is received but not being saved properly

## üîß How to Enable Recurring Payments

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration on Production
```sql
-- Run this on production database
ALTER TABLE "colibrrri_subscriptions" 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "isRecurring" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "recurringToken" TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "recurringMode" TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "nextPaymentDate" TIMESTAMP(3),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "lastPaymentDate" TIMESTAMP(3),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "failedPaymentAttempts" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "maxFailedAttempts" INTEGER DEFAULT 3;
```

### Step 2: Configure WayForPay Buttons
1. Login to WayForPay merchant portal
2. Edit payment buttons:
   - Enable "Regular payments" option
   - Set payment frequency to "Monthly"
   - Enable token generation

### Step 3: Test Recurring Payment Flow
1. Make a test payment with recurring enabled
2. Verify recToken is saved in database
3. Check if auto payment job processes it

## üìÖ Auto Payment Schedule

- **Processing**: Every hour (checks for due payments)
- **Retry Logic**: Failed payments retry next day
- **Max Attempts**: 3 failures before cancellation
- **Expiry Check**: Daily at 10 AM

## üîç How Recurring Payments Work

1. **Initial Payment**
   - User makes first payment via WayForPay
   - WayForPay returns `recToken` if recurring is enabled
   - System saves token and sets `isRecurring = true`

2. **Automatic Renewal**
   - Cron job runs hourly
   - Finds subscriptions where `nextPaymentDate <= now`
   - Uses `recurringToken` to charge payment
   - Updates subscription and adds credits

3. **Failure Handling**
   - Failed payment increments `failedPaymentAttempts`
   - Retries next day (up to 3 times)
   - After 3 failures: cancels subscription

## üìù Testing Checklist

- [ ] Apply database migration on production
- [ ] Configure WayForPay buttons for recurring
- [ ] Make test payment and verify recToken saved
- [ ] Wait for next hour to see auto payment attempt
- [ ] Check logs for recurring payment processing
- [ ] Verify credits added after successful renewal

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Security**: Recurring tokens are sensitive - never expose in logs
2. **Testing**: Use small amounts (1 UAH) for testing
3. **Monitoring**: Check logs regularly for failed payments
4. **User Communication**: Notify users before auto-charging

## üìä Current Statistics

- **Active Recurring Subscriptions**: 0
- **Subscriptions with Tokens**: 0
- **Failed Payment Attempts**: 0
- **Successful Auto Payments**: 0
